# sign-up-form
## Brief description
This is a project of The Odin Project concerning HTML Forms in which I have to make a sign up form according to a provided image.

## How the process of building it was like
Well, I didn't know where to start, as I had to do many things I didn't know about. The first thing I did was import all the necessary images and fonts, to then set the background to an image. 

Luckily, I was able to use the `position` command in order to place the elements correctly, especially the logo. Using `position: relative` in the parent and `position: absolute` really helped me.

After that, with some flexbox, I made a container to put on the form. The scaling was made with many units, including `rem`, `px` and lots of `vw` and `vh`. It was a real test which was worth it.
